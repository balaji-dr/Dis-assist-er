## Description
  Finding and locating survivors during a natural calamity is a difficult task. With the technology available today, it can be simplified and made easy. The easier the task gets, the more number of people get saved. Lets consider a simple scenario where the people want to circulate a piece of information to the search squad for helping them to locate the victim or requesting them to share any information about a victim. Victims can ask for help and their problem is analysed and is given a specific emotion value which denotes the priority value of the problem. Volunteers who are connected to the internet can view these posts and reach out to them. They will see the posts according to the priority of the problem. They can also search for a particular category in which they are willing to help with the help of a chat bot.
  
## Features
- Online mode to ask for help from anyone.
- Emotion recognition to prioritize the problems.
- Bot helps to find the issue that the user can solve based on the location and category.
- Have track of resolved issues/ ongoing issues in all affected areas
- Chat system helps to locate the victim (Incomplete due to time constraints)
- Offline operation for search and rescue (Incomplete due to time constraints)

## Future Work 
Considering a scenario where some one trapped and wants to reach out to the search squad. A search squad can find people by simply searching for victims using this app which allows the trapped person to host a connection (mobile hotspot). The victims can ask for help by just switching to the help mode where all the connectivity takes place offline and does not require a internet connection.
